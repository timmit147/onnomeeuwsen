                    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                    <p>In the Netherlands, we have made significant progress in acceptance of the queer community, especially when we look back on the past with its centuries of oppression, discrimination, and persecution. Even though queer people now have the same opportunities as heterosexual people, the phrase “being in the closet” still remains relevant for many queer men.</p>
                    <p>The still lifes that I paint symbolize persons, each with their own characters and personalities. The composition of the objects creates mutual connections between the objects that leave the viewer questioning their relationship. In my practice, the mutual connection of queer men and showcasing the role of power dynamics are at the center. In my work, I try to find a balance between heavy, loaded subject matter and humor and irony.</p>
                    <p>Social media and especially the hookup app Grindr are an inspiration source for my paintings. The sex-centered app that meant to connect queer men has turned into a toxic environment creating an emotional void between queer men. Profiles look like virtual billboards where users try to sell themselves. You come across countless shirtless torsos where the face is cropped off. The anonymity and discretion of the app create a space where people don’t have to take accountability for their actions and start to voice their worst thoughts, resulting in a grim world where people are being sexualized and objectified, being seen as objects with genitals instead of humans with feelings.</p>
                    <p>I want my paintings to serve as a reflection and not as criticism. My goal is to show the layers of the queer scene on Grindr, which is unknown to many.</p>
